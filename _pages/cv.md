{% include base_path %}

Originally from the Ashburn, Virginia (suburbs of Washington, DC), I studied Biostatistics and Biology at the University of Virginia and Statistical Science at Duke University. Currently I do health policy research on real-world evidence generation, including data quality, observational statistical methods, and mobile health. Previous experience with statistical consulting for non-profits and policy development in biomedical innovation and pharmacoepidemiology. I'm current interests include Bayesian statistics, interpretability of machine learning methods, and causal inference.

Outside of professional life I enjoy spending time with my Shichon and Cavachon pups (see below), rooting for Arsenal (Go Gunners), reading plot summaries of bad movies I will never see, and candlemaking.
