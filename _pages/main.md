I'm a Research Assistant at the [Duke-Margolis Center for Health Policy](https://healthpolicy.duke.edu/). I currently research policy and methods for real-world evidence generation, including data quality, observational statistical methods, and mobile health. 

I have previous experience with statistical consulting for non-profits and policy development for biomedical innovation and pharmacoepidemiology. My current interests include Bayesian statistics, interpretability of machine learning methods, and causal inference.
